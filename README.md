# Kotlin Application

Home project created with SpringBoot but instead of Java, Kotlin is used.

## How to use

Currently, the application requires a running MongoDB instance, see `application.properties` for more information.

The caller can add, remove, load abbreviations from the database.

## Missing part/future plans

- tests (unit/integration)
- multiple profiles (local, dev, integration)
- handle repeating definitions
